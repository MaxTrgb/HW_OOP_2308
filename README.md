# HW_OOP_2308
Create a Person base class that contains fields for name and age.
Next, create Student and Teacher subclasses that inherit from the Person class.
In the Student subclass, add a field for the grades and a method to calculate the GPA, and in the Teacher subclass, add a field for the subject taught and a method to display information about the teacher.
Create an array of students and teachers, output information about each person using polymorphism.
